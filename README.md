# Efficacy of MLB Switch Hitters

The idea behind this project was to determine if switch hitters were actually "worth it" or if they should just focus on hitting with their strongest hand.
This project made use of the [ThinkStats](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2) repo from Alan Downey.

## Notes
The data from the project was scraped from baseball-reference.com. This was a fun learning experience because this is not a static HTML site. So in order to scrape the data, 
I needed to initiate a headless web browser. This allowed the html to become accessible and scraped via BeautifulSoup.
